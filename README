To compile the program
g++ main.cpp

To run the program
./a.out

The following files are needed for TRUSS OPTIMIZATION
1> matrix.cpp  ->  Implements matrix manipulations
2> truss.cpp   ->  Truss solver
3> de.cpp      ->  Differential Evolution
4> main.cpp    ->  The main program
5> main.exe    ->  The main EXECUTABLE file


On executing main.exe, the two files are searched for
1> de.dat     -> Stores some DE parameters
2> truss.dat  -> Stores the truss structure


Format for de.dat
<lower limit for members> <upper limits for members>
<permissible stress> <permissible displacements in both x, y directions>
<constant penalty> 
<Population size>
<lower limit for F> <upper limit for F>
<lower limit for CR> <upper limit for CR>


Format for truss.dat
<total nodes>
{for each of the nodes the following are to be given}
	<x cor> <ycor>  <is force in x-dir known(y/n)> <value if y>
					<is force in y-dir known(y/n)> <value if y>
					<is disp. in x-dir known(y/n)> <value if y>
					<is disp. in y-dir known(y/n)> <value if y>
{for each node pair (i, j) j>i the following are to be given}
	<is node i connected to node j(y/n)> <area if y>
<Youngs modulus>

Notes:
1> Each node must either have force B.C.s or displacement B.C.s
2> The members are numbered on the basis of nodes
   (e.g. member 1 connects nodes 1, 2 & member 2 connects nodes 1 & 3, & so on..)
3> Since DE is an evolution based algo, each run is likely to give different answers.
